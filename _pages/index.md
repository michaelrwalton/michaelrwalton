Hi! I'm a Boston based software engineer with 15 years of experience developing web applications and APIs. I've been building websites and web apps since my early days in college, where I fell in love with the endless possibilies and ideas that I could create.

I have a passion for creating unique and fun experiences that are a joy to use, while being committed to using modern solutions and techniques to get there. I also am an advocate for improving the developer experience through strong DevOps processes and automation.
